1. Proposal was already submitted last week. 

2. The AVX portion of "sin4_intrin()" was modified to improve it's accuracy 
to 12-digits. Output from the program after modification was as follows: 

Reference time: 1.6549
Taylor time:    19.5345     Error: 6.928236e-12
Intrin time:    0.0312      Error: 6.928236e-12
Vector time:    0.0327      Error: 2.454130e-03

Extra Credit: Did not attempt

3. Processor/Architecture specifications shown below:  
Processor used: Intel Core i5-1035G4 CPU (x64-based processor)
Processor speed: 1.50 GHz
Number of cores: 4

The scan was parallelized by modifying the provided "scan_omp" function. 
Runtimes with different thread numbers are shown below. Note, runtimes were
averaged over 10 repeats.  

0 threads  : 0.676 s
2 threads  : 0.441 s
4 threads  : 0.405 s
8 threads  : 0.388 s
16 threads : 0.404 s
32 threads : 0.443 s
