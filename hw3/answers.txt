1. Proposal was already submitted last week. 

2. The AVX portion of "sin4_intrin()" was modified to improve it's accuracy 
to 12-digits. Output from the program after modification was as follows: 

Reference time: 1.6549
Taylor time:    19.5345     Error: 6.928236e-12
Intrin time:    0.0312      Error: 6.928236e-12
Vector time:    0.0327      Error: 2.454130e-03

Extra Credit: Did not attempt

3. Processor/Architecture specifications shown below:  
Linserv1 machine used
Processor: AMD Opteron(TM) Processor 6272 (x86_64 based processor)
Processor: 2.1 GHz
Number of cores per socket: 8
Number of threads per core: 2

The scan was parallelized by modifying the provided "scan_omp" function. 
Runtimes with different thread numbers are shown below. Note, runtimes were
averaged over 5 repeats.  

Serial run : 1.701 s
2 threads  : 1.449 s
4 threads  : 0.774 s
8 threads  : 0.379 s
16 threads : 0.220 s
32 threads : 0.190 s
64 threads : 0.184 s
No further speedup observed.
