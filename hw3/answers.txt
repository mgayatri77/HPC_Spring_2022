1. Proposal was already submitted last week. 

2. I modified the AVX portion of "sin4_intrin()" to improve it's accuracy 
to 12-digits. Output from the program after modification was as follows: 

Reference time: 1.6549
Taylor time:    19.5345     Error: 6.928236e-12
Intrin time:    0.0312      Error: 6.928236e-12
Vector time:    0.0327      Error: 2.454130e-03

Extra Credit: 

3. I parallelized the scan by modifying the provided "scan_omp" function. 
Runtimes with different thread numbers are shown below.
